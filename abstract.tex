In the Part B graph theory course we proved a formulation of Menger's theorem with a slick application of the max-flow-min-cut theorem. In this essay, we present a constructive proof of a slight generalisation of that theorem and then move to present the relevant definitions required for a rough introduction to infinite graph theory and a discussion of Aharoni and Berger's proof of a version of Menger's theorem for infinite graphs.
